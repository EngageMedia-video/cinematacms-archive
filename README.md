## CinemataCMS: An Enhanced MediaCMS-based Video Platform for Asia-Pacific Social Issue Films

[Cinemata](https://cinemata.org) is an open-source project that builds upon [MediaCMS](https://github.com/mediacms-io/mediacms), enhancing it with features specifically designed for showcasing social issue films from the Asia-Pacific region. Since its public release in 2021, Cinemata has developed numerous features that were previously exclusive to its platform and not available in the core MediaCMS. The project is managed by EngageMedia, an Asia-Pacific non-profit advocating for digital rights, open-technology and social issue films.

Our goal is to make these Cinemata-specific integrations and improvements to MediaCMS available to the public, enabling more organizations to maximize the potential of this powerful video content management system.

### Key features:
- [Core MediaCMS features](https://github.com/mediacms-io/mediacms)
- Cinemata-specific enhancements:
  - [Multi-Factor Authentication](https://github.com/EngageMedia-video/cinematacms/blob/main/docs/security/mfa_authentication.md)
  - Custom CSS and UI components for a unique, tailored look distinct from baseline MediaCMS
  - Featured video and playlists on the front page
  - Customised playlists and embedding options on the front page
  - Integration of [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp) ASR model for English translation
  - Ability to upload, edit, and download .SRT files for subtitles or captions
  - Expanded user roles that include a Truster User, who has greater access to site features relating to publishing and the ASR model.

### History

Cinemata's content originates from EngageMedia's previous video platform, which operated from 2006 to 2020 using the Plumi video content management system. By migrating this valuable archive to an improved MediaCMS-based platform, we're ensuring the preservation and continued accessibility of essential narratives from the region. Since its launch, the current Cinemata site has added more than 2,000 videos contributed by its active users, further enriching its collection of social issue films. Cinemata is co-developed by Markos Gogoulos of MediaCMS.

‚ÄúCinemata‚Äù comes from the combination of ‚Äúcine‚Äù, which means ‚Äúmotion picture‚Äù, and ‚Äúmata‚Äù, which means ‚Äúeye‚Äù in several regional languages:

- In Bahasa Malaysia, Bahasa Indonesia, and Filipino, the word for ‚Äúeye‚Äù is ‚Äúmata‚Äù
- In Tetum (East Timor), the word for ‚Äúeye‚Äù is ‚Äúmatan‚Äù
- In Vietnamese, the word for ‚Äúeye‚Äù is ‚Äúm·∫Øt‚Äù
- In Thai and Lao, the word for ‚Äúeye‚Äù is ‚Äúta‚Äù

‚ÄúCinemata‚Äù represents our focus on highlighting Asia-Pacific perspectives and connecting issues, films, and filmmakers in the region.
